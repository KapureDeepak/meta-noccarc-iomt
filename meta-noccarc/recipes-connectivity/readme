This tarball is kept for futher improvements in the configuration of network manager.
the current method employed to configure network manager is to expand and install the scripts at boot. this is working perfectly fine for now.
The tarball contains scripts and patches that are applied in networkmanager_%.bbappend itself, changing the configuration during compile time. Delete the readme once this method is implemented.
